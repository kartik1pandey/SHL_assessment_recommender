    "### Why Disagreement is Expected\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linguistic Ambiguity**: Job descriptions are inherently ambiguous and incomplete. The same role can be described using different terminology, emphasis, and level of detail. Human experts bring their own professional experience and domain knowledge to interpretation, while our model relies purely on semantic similarity in embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Dependency**: Skills importance varies significantly based on organizational context, team structure, and specific role requirements that may not be fully captured in the job description text. Human experts can infer these contextual factors, while our model operates on the explicit textual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subjective Professional Judgment**: Even among human experts, there would be disagreement about skill importance. Our validation represents one expert's judgment, but in practice, different hiring managers, HR professionals, and domain experts would provide different weightings based on their experience and priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Embedding Limitations**: While transformer-based embeddings capture rich semantic relationships, they may not perfectly align with human professional intuition about skill-job relationships. The model learns from general language patterns, not specifically from HR/recruitment domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Probabilistic Modeling Helps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uncertainty Quantification**: By representing skill requirements as probability distributions rather than deterministic labels, we explicitly acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in job-skill matching. This prevents overconfident downstream decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graceful Degradation**: Probabilistic distributions ensure that even skills with lower probability remain in consideration. This prevents the brittle failure modes that occur with hard classification approaches where skills are either \"required\" or \"not required.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Downstream Robustness**: Causal modeling and recommendation algorithms can incorporate the uncertainty in skill distributions, leading to more robust and reliable assessment recommendations. The probability distributions provide natural weights for downstream optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Validity**: The probabilistic approach aligns with the reality that job requirements exist on a continuum rather than as binary categories. This methodological choice enhances the ecological validity of our assessment recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretability**: Probability distributions provide interpretable confidence measures that can be communicated to end users, enabling more informed decision-making in assessment selection."
